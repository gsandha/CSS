    <!-- Selectors are one of the key concepts in CSS that allow you to target specific HTML elements in a web page and apply styles to them. A selector is a pattern that matches one or more HTML elements based on their type, class, ID, attributes, and/or their relationship to other elements.

Here are some common types of selectors in CSS:

Type selectors: These selectors target elements based on their type, such as p for paragraphs, h1 for headings, ul for unordered lists, etc.

Class selectors: These selectors target elements that have a specific class attribute value, denoted by a dot (.) followed by the class name, such as .my-class.

ID selectors: These selectors target elements that have a specific ID attribute value, denoted by a hash (#) followed by the ID name, such as #my-id.

Attribute selectors: These selectors target elements based on their attribute values, such as [href] to select all elements with an href attribute, or [data-type="button"] to select elements with a data-type attribute set to "button".

Pseudo-classes: These selectors target elements based on their state or position, such as :hover to select elements when the user hovers over them, :nth-child(n) to select elements based on their position in the parent element, etc.

Combinators: These selectors combine two or more selectors to create more specific targeting, such as element1 element2 to select all element2 elements that are descendants of element1, or element1 + element2 to select the element2 immediately following element1.

Using selectors in CSS allows you to apply styles to specific elements, groups of elements, or even all elements in a web page. Understanding selectors is a fundamental skill for working with CSS and creating responsive, visually appealing web pages. -->
