    <!-- clip-path is a CSS property that allows you to create custom shapes by clipping an element to a specific geometric shape or path. This can be used to create unique and creative visual effects on web pages.

The clip-path property takes a value that specifies the shape or path to use as a clipping mask. There are several ways to specify the clipping mask, including:

Basic shapes: You can use keywords such as circle, ellipse, inset, or polygon to define simple shapes as the clipping mask.

SVG path: You can use an SVG path to define a complex shape as the clipping mask.

Image mask: You can use an image as the clipping mask by using the url() function. -->
